## A bit of theory

Image classification involves two primary steps: `feature detection` and `classification`.

**Feature detection** can be efficiently performed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which automatically detect important features without any human supervision. CNNs are designed to process data in the form of multiple arrays, ideal for image data, by applying filters to recognize patterns, edges, and textures.
The **classification** step often utilizes a feedforward network with dense nodes, known as a Fully Connected Layer (FCL), to classify the image into various categories based on the detected features. The FCL takes the high-level features identified by the CNN and combines them to make a final prediction.

For a detailed understanding, TensorFlow's tutorials provide a comprehensive guide on using CNNs for image classification: [TensorFlow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification).

Additionally, the concept of feature detection and classification is well-detailed in the academic literature, such as the seminal paper by Krizhevsky et al., "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks", available on [Neural Information Processing Systems](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf).

## Features
In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used for image processing, features can be categorized into three levels based on their complexity and abstraction: low-level, mid-level, and high-level features.

### Low-Level Features

Low-level features are the basic building blocks of an image, typically captured in the initial layers of a CNN. These features include edges, corners, colors, and textures. They are straightforward, simple patterns that do not convey much about the content of the image but are crucial for the initial stage of processing. For example, detecting the boundaries and basic shapes within an image falls under low-level feature detection.

### Mid-Level Features

As we move deeper into the network, the CNN starts to combine low-level features to form mid-level features. These features represent more complex patterns that can be interpreted as parts of objects within the image, such as wheels, windows (in the context of vehicles), or eyes and mouths (in the context of faces). Mid-level features bridge the gap between simple patterns and the recognition of whole objects, capturing the essence of object parts without identifying the object as a whole.

### High-Level Features

High-level features are detected in the deeper layers of the CNN. These features represent entire objects or even scenes, incorporating a high level of abstraction and complexity. At this stage, the network has combined lower-level features to recognize complex patterns and objects, such as cars, trees, or human faces. High-level features allow the network to make decisions about what is present in the image, leading to classifications or identifications in tasks like image recognition, object detection, and scene understanding.

The progression from low-level to high-level features in a CNN mirrors the way humans visually process information: starting from basic visual cues and moving towards complex interpretations. This hierarchical processing enables CNNs to effectively handle a wide range of image recognition and classification tasks by learning to recognize patterns of increasing complexity.
